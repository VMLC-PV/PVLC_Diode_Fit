First version of the script. I alos tried to implement some test for the dark non-ideal diode equation which seems to be OK.
Also looks like the light JV gives similar results than the pvlib (https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/tree/master/pvlib) one, but I could not find a good way to test them.
Looks like at high current the error in the computation of the current is quite significant such that the superposition of the light current and the dark + Jph does not really work... Not 100% sure why.
